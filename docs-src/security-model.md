# Security Model

## Introduction
The Service APIs have been designed to enable granular authorization for each
role in a typical organization. 

## Resources
The Service APIs have 3 primary API resources:

* **GatewayClass** defines a set of gateways with a common configuration and
  behavior.
* **Gateway** requests a point where traffic can be translated to Services
  within the cluster.
* **Routes** describe how traffic coming via the Gateway maps to the Services.

### Additional Configuration
There are two additional pieces of configuration that are important in this
security model:

* Which namespaces can contain Gateways of the specified GatewayClass.
* Which namespaces Routes can be targeted in by Gateways of the specified
  GatewayClass.

## Roles
For the purposes of this security model, 3 common roles have been identified:

* **Infrastructure provider**: The infrastructure provider (infra) is
  responsible for the overall environment that the cluster(s) are operating in.
  Examples include: the cloud provider (AWS, Azure, GCP, ...), the PaaS provider
  in a company.
* **Cluster operator**: The cluster operator (ops) is responsible for
  administration of entire clusters. They manage policies, network access,
  application permissions.
* **Application developer**: The application developer (dev) is responsible for
  defining their application configuration (e.g. timeouts, request
  matching/filter) and Service composition (e.g. path routing to backends). 

Although these roles can cover a wide variety of use cases, some organizations
may be structured slightly differently. Many organizations may also have a
fourth role that sits between "cluster operator" and "application developer":

* **Application admin**: The application admin has administrative access to some
  namespaces within a cluster, but not the cluster as a whole.

## The Security Model
There are two primary components to the Service APIs security model: RBAC and
namespace restrictions.

## RBAC
RBAC (role-based access control) is the standard used for Kubernetes
authorization. This allows users to configure who can perform actions on
resources in specific scopes. RBAC can be used to enable each of the roles
defined above. In most cases, it will be desirable to have all resources be
readable by most roles, so instead we'll focus on write access for this model.

### Write Permissions for Simple 3 Tier Model 
| | GatewayClass | Gateway | Route |
|-|-|-|-|
| Infrastructure Provider | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Cluster Operators | No | Yes | Yes |
| Application Developers | No | No | Yes |

### Write Permissions for Advanced 4 Tier Model 
| | GatewayClass | Gateway | Route |
|-|-|-|-|
| Infrastructure Provider | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Cluster Operators | Sometimes | Yes | Yes |
| Application Admins | No | In Specified Namespaces | In Specified Namespaces |
| Application Developers | No | No | In Specified Namespaces |

## Namespace Restrictions
The extra configuration options are not possible to control with RBAC. Instead,
they will be controlled with configuration fields on GatewayClasses:

* **gatewayNamespaceSelector**: This field is a selector of namespaces. Gateways
that run in matched namespaces can use this GatewayClass. This is a standard
Kubernetes LabelSelector. Controllers must not support Gateways in namespaces
outside this selector. An empty selector (default) indicates that this GatewayClass
is available to use by Gateways in any namespace.

* **allowedRouteNamespaces**: AllowedRouteNamespaces indicates in which
  namespaces Routes can be selected for Gateways of this class. This is
  restricted to the namespace of the Gateway by default.
  
## Controller Requirements
To be considered conformant with the Service APIs spec, controllers need to:

* Populate status fields on Gateways and Resources to indicate if they are
  compatible with the corresponding GatewayClass configuration.
* Not implement invalid configuration. Fore example, if a route is referenced in
  an invalid namespace for the GatewayClass, it should be ignored. 
* Respond to changes in GatewayClass configuration that may change which
  Gateways or Routes are valid.

## Alternative Approaches Considered
### New API Resources
We considered introducing new API resources to cover these use cases. These
resources might be look something like:

* **ClusterGateway**: A ClusterGateway could reference routes in any namespace.
* **ClusterRoute**: A ClusterRoute could be referenced by any Gateway or
  ClusterGateway.

**Benefits**

* Easy to model with RBAC.
* API validation tied directly to each resource.

**Downsides**

* New resources to deal with - more informers, clients, documentation, etc.
* Harder to expand with additional options in the future - may just end up with
  tons of API resources to cover all use cases.

### Boolean Multi Namespace Route Indicator on GatewayClass
Instead of having the `routeNamespaceSelector` field on GatewayClass, we would
use a boolean `multiNamespaceRoutes` field to indicate if Gateways of this class
can target routes in multiple namespaces. This would default to false. A false
value here would indicate that routes could only be targeted in the current
namespace. 

**Benefits**

* Helpful for multi-tenant use cases with many isolated Gateways.
* Simple configuration with an easy to understand default value.

**Downsides**

* GatewayClass admins are unable to partially limit namespaces that can be
  targeted by Gateways. Admins would have to choose between allowing access to
  Routes in all namespaces or only the local one.

### Validating Webhook
A validating webhook could potentially handle some of the cross-resource
validation necessary for this security model and provide more immediate feedback
to end users. 

**Benefits**

* Immediate validation feedback.
* More validation logic stays in core Service APIs codebase.

**Downsides**

* Imperfect solution for cross-resource validation. For example, a change to a
  GatewayClass could affect the validity of corresponding Gateway.
* Additional complexity involved in installing Service APIs in a cluster.
